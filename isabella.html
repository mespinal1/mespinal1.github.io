    <h2>
What is the greenhouse effect?    </h2>
    <h3>
The short answer is the natural warming of the Earth that results from when gases, from the atmosphere, trap heat from the sun, that would otherwise be released back into space.    </h3>
    <h2>
What are the causes of the greenhouse effect?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Without sunlight we would not be able to live on Earth as it is the prime source of energy, allowing it to be habitable. With this in mind, around 30% of the sunlight that reaches Earth is reflected back in space, meaning that 70% is absorbed by our world. The sunlight that is ab

    <h4>
      Fossil Fuels are natural fuels formed in the geological past from the remains of living organisms. An example of a greehouse gas is carbon dioxide, also kown as CO2, that is relased into the atmosphere through cars or factories.
<h3>
  How do these fossils fuels cause climate change?
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Fossil fuels alone are not the sole cause of climate change, but when they are burned then relased into the atmosphere
