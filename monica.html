    <h3>
      How have refrigerants been affecting climate change?
    </h3>
    Well the certain gases used in refrigerants are classified as <b>ozone depleting substances</b>. Therefore, when these gases enter the atmosphere, they are capable of warming the Earth, by forming a “blanket” at high altitudes. These gases have 9,000 greater capacity to warm the atmosphere than CO2. This causes the temperature to change at a rapid speed, which also leads to weather change, and many other environmental changes in the Earth.
    
    <h3>
      What is refrigerant management? How will it help solve climate change?
  </h3>
    <p>
      Being ranked one of the top, most possible solutions, refrigerant management is the proper handling of refrigerants in heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC/R). Refrigerant management makes sure ozone depleting gases are properly disposed of because eventually these gases will leak or be released into the atmosphere. 
    </p>
  <p>
      A study made by Project Drawdown demonstrates that by the year 2050, refrigerant management could reduce about 89.7 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions, which is the highest reduction of emissions that has been studied.

    <h2>
      Reducing Food Waste
    </h2>
      <h3>
        How is food waste affecting climate change?
    </h3>
    <p>
    The total food that has been wasted around the world has become the 3rd highest greenhouse gas emitter. About one-third of this food is wasted every year, which is enough food to feed about 3 billion people. Overtime, wasted food in landfills breakdown and form methane, which is a greenhouse gas that's about 84 times stronger than carbon dioxide (CO2).
    </p>
    <h3>
      How can you help reduce food waste?
    </h3>
  <p>
    You can help reduce food waste by remembering to plan, store, eat, and speak.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Plan</b> by making shopping lists to prevent overbuying food. You should mainly buy the items you need.</li>
      <li><b>Store</b> by putting away food in the right places and in the right temperature. For example, meats and seafood should be stored in freezers so they could be perserved for a much longer time.</li>
      <li><b>Eat.</b> Don't just throw away food you don't want anymore. If you are going to serve yourself, try giving yourself a bit of food first and if you are still not full, serve yourself a bit more. Don't just waste the food you have stored. Before it goes bad, try to find ways you could use the food item in your kitchen, and if the food goes bad, look for recipes or ways that you could use the food that has gone bad.</li>
     <li><b>Speak</b> up about reducing food waste. Mention to others how it is one step closer to helping defeat climate change and how it will help the World in wonderful ways. You could even help others figure out ways to reduce the amount of food they waste.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
  <h3>
    How will reducing food waste help solve climate change?
  </h3>
  <p>
    According to a study made by Project Drawdown, reducing food waste can prevent an estimated 87.45 - 94.56 gigatons of greenhouse gases from being emitted into the atmosphere by the year 2050.
