      A <b>climate refugee</b> is a person who has been forced to leave their
      home as a result of the effects of climate change on their environment.

      However, the term "climate refugee" does not exist in international law;
      neither the United Nations of any international agency that works with
      refugees or climate change recognises any particular definition or name.
      Thus, climate refugees may also be referred to as
      <b>climate migrants</b> or <b>environmental migrants</b>. Although the
      term "climate refugee" is popularly used in media, it can be misleading
      for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ul style="color:darkslategrey;">
      <li>
        As of now, climate refugees do not/will not have the same
        <b>legal status</b> as other refugees acknowledged by international law.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most climate refugees will be <b>internally displaced</b>. This means
        that rather than fleeing international borders, as many traditional
        refugees would, climate refugees would migrate to other areas within
        their country of residence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many people fleeing climate disasters would dislike being referred to as
        a "refugee", as this term comes with many <b>stigmas</b> and legal and
        social assumptions.
      </li>
    </ul>

      How do we expect climate change to create climate refugees?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Currently, extremely hot, unlivable zones like the Sahara, cover less than
      1% of Earth.
      <b>By 2070, unlivable hot zones could cover nearly 1/5 of the land</b>,
      placing 1 of every 3 people in an unlivable zone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Climate change is forcing families to flee water scarcity, crop failure,
      and rising sea levels, as well as worsening natural disasters. The effects
      of climate change will affect the poorest people the worst, especially in
      developing countries; in Sub-Saharan Afica, South Asia, and Latin America,
      it is estimated that as many as <b>143 million people</b> could be
      displaced by climate change by 2050. Such a shift will overburden already
      crowded urban areas, especially in developing countries that already are
      behind when it comes to infrastructure, housing, and public services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if urgent steps are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
      governments commit to combating climate change, in a best case scenario,
      40 million people from those regions would still be displaced.
    </p>
    <p><b>Northern nations</b> will naturally take on many climate migrants:</p>
    <u1>
      <li>
        The natural environments of countries in the global north are
        <b>less susceptible</b> in many ways to the effects of climate change,
        as opposed to those in the global south or those near the equator
      </li>
      <li>
        Northern nations tend to be <b>more developed</b> and have better
        economies than southern ones
      </li>
      <li>
        Many nations in the global North face a <b>demographic decline</b> that
        could in fact benefit from younger, fit-to-work incoming migrants
      </li>
    </u1>
    <p>
      However, many Northern nations, notably the United States, have
      <b>strong opposition</b> to immigration, especially the large influx of
      immigrats that is expected to arise from climate change. A proper
      acceptance of climate migrants would first require the choice of a country
      to allow and welcome migrants, rather than continue to shut them out. It
      will also require <b>good will</b>,
      <b>careful management of political differences</b>, and the
      <b>preparation of climate refuge cities</b>.

    <h2>
      How can we prepare for climate migrants?
    </h2>
    <h4>
      The future of sustainable urban development
    </h4>
    <p>
      A key way in which we can prepare for climate migrants is through
      <b>sustainable urban development</b> - developing cities in ways that are
      <b>environmentally sustainable</b>,
      <b>culturally diverse and welcoming</b>, and
      <b>full of economic opportunities</b>. Through sustainable urban
      development, cities will not only be prepared for, but be able to benefit
      from, incoming climate migrants. Although sustainable urban development is
      complex and can differ depending on each city's unique situation, there
      are many sustainable initiatives that are generally viewed as extremely
      important and beneficial to any urban area:
    </p>
    <u1>
      <li>
        Protecting <b>green space and the natural environment</b> of urban areas
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Pedestrianizing</b> cities by banning cars in zones within the city
        and designating more streets to people and bikes
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Redeveloping vacant lots and buildings</b> into housing, parks, small
        solar farms, gardens, or other local initiatives
      </li>
      <li>
        Utilizing <b>compact design</b> by developing up or under, rather than
        out
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Diversifying housing options</b>, providing a place to live for
        people of diverse incomes, lifestyles, and demographics
      </li>
      <li>Providing <b>high-quality public transportation</b></li>
      <li>
        Adopt <b>people-first policies</b> that prioritize cultural diversity,
        education, healthcare, and the overall wellbeing of people living in
        cities, especially those from underprivileged communities
      </li>
    </u1>
    <h4>
      Potential climate refuge cities
    </h4>
    <p>
      It is crucial that future climate refuge cities have:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        relatively
        <b>low-risk of being affected by climate-related disasters</b> such as
        flooding, wildfires, storms, extreme heat, and drought
      </li>
      <li><b>sustainable access to water</b></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Some cities may be better equipped than others to receive climate
      refugees. For example, cities in the US <b>Rust Belt</b> have historical
      advantages. They used to be major manufacturing centers, but due to the
      globalization of steel, automobile, and other manufacturing industries, by
      the 21st century, there are many vacant properties of low value. This
      makes Rust Belt cities good candidates for climate-centered redevelopment
      projects. Additionally, Rust Belt cities are not threatened by rising sea
      levels but still have access to water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cities that have been identified by experts as ideal receiver cities
      include <b>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</b>, <b>Portland, Oregon</b>, and
      <b>Charlotte, North Carolina</b>.
